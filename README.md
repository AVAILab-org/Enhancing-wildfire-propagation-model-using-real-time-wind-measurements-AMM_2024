 **************************************************************************************************************
 *  FireProM-F v2							    				      *
 *  Authors: Paolo Grasso, Mauro Innocente, Mohammad Tavakol Sadrabadi
 


 *  This version is directly utilised in the following paper:                                                 *

    " Enhancing Wildfire Propagation Model Predictions Using UAV Swarm-Based
     Real-Time Wind Measurements: A Conceptual Framework "published in the  
     Journal of applied Mathemaical Modelling. 



 *  The Code functions are stored in the "FireProMF code" directory with the main                             *
    algorithm in the FireProMF_02 file and the wrapper function in the MainTestFire file.



 *  wind vector values used for the experiments in the paper are stired in the "wind data" folder.            *



 *  Visual outputs of Energy field (for burnt area) of fuel and Temperature field (for fire line)            *
    are stored as GIF files accessible in the outputs directory.
